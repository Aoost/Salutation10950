# ASCII Art Birthday Card Web App for Cristina

## Background and Motivation

The user wants to create an animated ASCII art birthday card for his girlfriend Cristina. The ASCII art is already created and stored in `BirthdayASCII.txt` and includes:
- Cristina's name in large ASCII letters (repeated multiple times)
- Detailed portrait-style ASCII art
- Decorative patterns and borders
- Philosophical text about yoga, meditation, and transformation
- A figure in meditation pose

**Requirements:**
- Display the ASCII art exactly as-is initially
- Add animation capabilities to portions of the art
- Web app format for easy sharing and cross-platform compatibility  
- Start with local hosting for development
- Simple, fast hosting solution for final deployment

**User Concern Addressed:** Hosting complexity - Modern static hosting services (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages) make web app deployment extremely simple with drag-and-drop or single-command deployment.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **ASCII Art Preservation**: Maintain exact spacing and formatting of the complex ASCII art
2. **Performance**: Large ASCII file (562 lines) needs efficient rendering
3. **Responsive Design**: Ensure ASCII art displays properly on different screen sizes
4. **Animation Integration**: Add animations without disrupting the original formatting
5. **Hosting**: Balance between local development ease and deployment simplicity

**Technical Approach:**
- HTML with `<pre>` tags or CSS `white-space: pre-wrap` to preserve ASCII formatting
- Vanilla JavaScript for animations to keep it lightweight
- CSS for styling and simple animations
- Local development server for testing
- Static hosting for deployment
