Alchemical process:
continual commitment of spirit. 

You find yourself working in ever broadening spirals.                                                                                               
The fruit of your love and attention:
                                                                                                       		
reciprocal reverberation

ripples of karma 
                                                                                                      	
like  celestial rings 
hold asteroids in check,
                                                                                                                                                                                             
				and
																															
Keep little siblings in their Milky lanes -

		protected
        from cosmic debris. 				

cyclical labour of sun and sphere and psyche

sure and slow,

under narrative gravity
 - selves are sloughed 

  and mountains cracked

A quantum dance 

with a nuclear Sun
