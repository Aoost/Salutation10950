you provide so much space for me to feel to the depths of things I'm experiencing,                                 Wishing you a very special experience in learning and bending, and growing.                             
and I don't think I tell you enough how much I love living with you.                                               This year, and all the years ahead.                                                                       
Thank you for the breakfasts,                                                                                      Happy birthday, cousin. (Emma)                                                                        
that one walk in Newlands forest that made my heart feel so so so big,                                                                                                                                                        
and for all of the years of seeing all the shadows and lights in each other. 
I hope to continue to see more in each other,                                                                                                                                                                                  
in depth and breadth, for the rest of our lives.                                                                    U da best - Sam

Dear Cristina.                                                                                                      Dear Nina,
Sending POSITIVELY THRILLING (+FREAKY) vibes for your birthday from Indonesia.                                       I feel incredibly grateful to be able to share this life with you.                                         
You have a gigantic heart, are a source of deep stillness,                                                           You hold so much care, wisdom, depth, joy, light, silliness and curiosity                                
and are an incredibly attentive and highly capable being.                                                            (I could go on and on and on), but damn it feels so inspiring, free and safe to be close to.               
You deserve all that you desire in this brief lifetime.                                                              To get to witness all your qualities express themselves through you,                                              
I’m proud and blessed to be your friend and collaborator, and to have known you for over 10 years!                   to those you love and to the world around you is beautiful 
Have a wonderful birthday and 30th year.                                                                             and  I can’t wait to watch and support all the adventures life takes you on. 
All the Love,                                                                                                        I hope the yoga training gives you a moment of pause, growth, 
Ross                                                                                                                 deeper discovery and guidance, and so much more.

Happy birthday, Cristina,  
your calm presence is so grounding
and I am so deeply grateful to know you, even through distance.

I’ve just realised we’ve known each other
and will always know each other just a year short of half our lives,
no matter how old we get you’ll be one of my oldest friends.  
And that’s the best news I’ve got all year.  
Happy 30th Birthday Neens, I love you always.
